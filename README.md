# SystemsDesign

1.Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
DriverPass is an application that allows those who are studying for their driver's license get a better understanding of the rules, have access to driving instructors, the latest test and regulations from the DMV, and to see their status in one place. The app fills the need of having better resources and training to obtain a driver License. The client noticed a huge void in the training and wanted to create an application that would help him monitor student progress and ensure success.
    
2. What did you do particularly well?
On this project, I understood the need and was able to diagram the activites and the use cases well.

3. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would choose to go over the system requirements and provide more detail. Ideally, I would have wanted to ask more follow up questions to the client to ensure I understood the whole application in terms I could  understand, such as, did he only want to work locally in his state or go national, or regional. But other than that, I feel pretty strongly about the design.

4. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the users in this case to be younger, so I assumed that they would be able to operate technology and that they would want a fast system, so I considered that aspect in my design. I also considered the use of mobile devices, so I wanted my interface to be simple and compelling. Not considering a user in the design process would result in a failure. The whole purpose of an application is to provide a solution to a problem, and if the user can't use it or won't engage, the project would be a waste of resources.

5. How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I consider other applicatoins and aspects of applications that I like and don't llke, then I consider the user's needs and how I can meet those while providing what I think will be the best, and easiest, product possible. I like to take a lot of work away from the user and give them less steps to get their solution, so I take user requirements and design the simplest user interface that will meet those needs, and I consider the back end portion of the application will do the heavy lifing of the app. Going forward, I will use the diagrams more often. Up until now, I had never used a diagram outside of desiging a database, but I find the diagrams to be exceptionally helpful in identifying possible issues with different portions of an application, such as forgetting a step, or not considering a contingency for a failed login attempt. The diagrams made me have to think about the actual sequence of events before just making the tool.

The idea of designing and documenting has always been a challenge for me. I don't know where to start, and what format I should use. This calss gave me the tools to get through the necessary step of documenting requirements and turning those into an application on papaer, something I have known to do, but have not known how to do, ultimately. I can now say that I know how to do that.
